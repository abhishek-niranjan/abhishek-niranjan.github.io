* This project focuses on studying how the popularity of different tasks an techniques related to Natural Language Processing Research emerge/varies with respect to time. 

* Extracted key-phrases and relations from citation-contexts from research articles to study the temporal emergence of various tasks and techniques in Computational Linguistics field. Clustered the research papers based on pre-defined groups such as research task addressed, approach of the solution, etc. by utilising supervised learning with tf-idf vectors of citation context as features. Built a citation network using NetworkX and Graphviz packages to study temporal variation and emergence of different applications and techniques in the field of Computational Linguistics. Future work involves improving the recall while tagging research articles with tasks and techniques.
