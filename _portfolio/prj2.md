* We analyzed a massive dataset comprising of nearly 1.5 million computer science articles and more than 26 million citation
contexts to understand the behavior of "Copying Citation Contexts" amongst the researchers. I conducted experiments involving cosine similarity measure to reveal the copying pattern in 24 fields of computer science, and examined the variation, of copying phenomena in the most cited research papers, in subsequent 5 years of their publication. _Research Paper accepted in Joint Conference on Digital Libraries(JCDL), 2017_
