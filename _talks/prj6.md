venue: 'IIT Kharagpur'

* I worked in a team of 15 members in Inter-Hall Software Development Competition to build a graph extractor that detects
plots in any PDF and digitizes the graphs. I was responsible to build a module which digitizes the plot lines using the pixel values from the graphical(BW) image by aptly scaling them to the given range of the axes imported from the OCR module using Python Imaging Library.
