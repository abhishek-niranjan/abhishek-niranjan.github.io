excerpt: 'The project aimed to translate the sign language gestures(ASL) to text by machine learning and language modeling.'
venue: 'IIT Kharagpur'

* I worked in a team to translate American sign language gestures to text using flex sensing gloves with positional sensors. We compared different classifiers on input data from sensory gloves to train the alpha-numerical character recognition algorithm, and built a statistical language model based on stochastic grammar to recognise meaningful words from a stream of characters.
